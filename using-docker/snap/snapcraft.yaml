summary: An example snap for interacting with the Docker snap
description: |
  This snap moves a Docker-based workflow to a snap'd environment on Ubuntu
  Core. This snap shows how one would interact with the Docker snap, namely
  through a content sharing interface exposed by the Docker snap to gain access
  to its executables and libraries, along with a collection of simple scripts to
  use those executables.

grade: stable
confinement: strict

# Due to recent changes in the Docker snap, snapd 2.59.1 is required.
# If an older version of snapd is needed, please use Docker on 18/stable.
assumes: [snapd2.59.1]

# The daemons are installed as disabled because the docker{-executables} and
# interfaces are not auto-connecting. They can be installed as enabled if
# interface auto-connection is enabled either in the Store UI or in the gadget snap.
